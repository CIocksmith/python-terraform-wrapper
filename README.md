# Python Terraform Wrapper

This is a Python-based wrapper designed to simplify the management of Terraform configurations. The project allows you to dynamically generate and manipulate Terraform configurations through Python scripts, providing an interface to work with Terraform commands like `apply`, `plan`, and `destroy`.

Through this project, I gained experience in integrating Python with Terraform and learned how to automate infrastructure management in a more flexible way using Python.

## What I Learned

### Python and Terraform Integration:

- I learned how to use Python to manage Terraform configurations dynamically by interacting with files such as `main.py`, `setup.py`, and `wrapper.py`.
- I explored how to use Python subprocess to execute Terraform commands (`apply`, `plan`, etc.), streamlining the process of interacting with Terraform from a Python environment.

### Mocking Terraform Variables:

- I gained insights into how to use mocked variables for simulating real Terraform resources without needing actual cloud credentials or infrastructure.
- The `mockvariables.tf` file allowed me to simulate the creation of cloud resources, such as EC2 instances and S3 buckets, for testing purposes without actual AWS access.

### Dynamic Terraform Configuration Generation:

- Through this project, I learned how to generate Terraform configurations dynamically based on user input or pre-configured parameters.
- The wrapper can generate `main.tf` dynamically, making it easy to modify and scale the infrastructure as needed.

### Managing Terraform Commands:

- I explored how to use Python scripts to call Terraform commands (`init`, `apply`, `plan`, `destroy`) and handle the subprocess outputs.
- This project allowed me to automate the workflow of initializing, applying, and managing Terraform resources directly through Python code.

### Error Handling and Debugging:

- I learned how to handle errors in the Terraform workflow, including simulating AWS resource creation without actual credentials and managing error messages generated by Terraform commands.
- This experience helped me understand common issues encountered while working with Terraform and how to handle them programmatically.

### Version Control and Collaboration:

- Throughout the development of this wrapper, I practiced using Git for version control. This allowed me to maintain a history of changes and collaborate with others by pushing the project to GitHub.
- By working with version control, I ensured that changes to the project were tracked and easily accessible for collaboration.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The entry point of the project, responsible for generating Terraform configuration and executing Terraform commands.
- `setup.py`: Contains setup instructions and configurations for running the Python wrapper.
- `wrapper.py`: Implements the core functionality for interacting with Terraform commands and generating configuration files.
- `mockvariables.tf`: Contains mocked values for various Terraform variables, simulating AWS resource configurations.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the necessary Python dependencies for the project.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
